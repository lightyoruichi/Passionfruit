Passionfruit Wishlist & Change Log

This is a roadmap of sorts, with a more playful approach. This can also be considered the 
home of all of the issues I've found. Think of it as Christmas time for passionfruit, what 
needs to be fixed and what should be added.

Changes in 1.0.2
-	Fixed browser detect bugs
-	Added plugin for initial thumbnail build (script you run if thumbs don't exist to get a 
	new gallery or album up and running without the need for external/additional prep)
-	Fixed htaccess file to include images in the gzip compression for faster load times
-	New cache rules for the htaccess file, allowing image storage in the browser cache
-	Update demo html/css, removing pixels for percentage to prevent the body being wider 
	then the browser viewport
-	Fiexd the $_fancybox.close runaway timer
-	The function now gathers image exif metadata, but doesn't do anything with it yet

Version 1.0.2 Wishlist
-	Separate passionfuit from the index.php file into it's own include as passionfruit.php
-	Combine javascript includes into a single file sans errors
-	iOS display error fix
-	Better documentation for 3rd party script implementation (help users access features in
	isotope, queryloader, bbq, cloud-zoom and fancybox)
-	Better optimization documentation (passionfruit can be slow if you have 200+ images)
-	Fix back button bug (inability to go back to the original load state)
-	Fix recursive gallery loading when 4+ levels deep

Version 1.1 Wishlist
-	Enable ajax/json API so you only load and append content you want to see instead of 
	being served the whole enchilada all at once (this is what makes this a 1.1 release)
-	Add plugin for external image storage support (S/FTP)
-	Automatic detection of sortable classes (from all meta.txt) and link creation 
-	Breadcrumbs with titles with links to active content
-	Add mobile plugin
-	meta.txt file generator on the demo site
-	Optimize php array and variable access in the passionfruit() php function
-	Access to image attributes in display interface (1.0.2 sets variables with exif data
	but does not pass it on to the browser for use, I don't have a good UI for it yet...)
