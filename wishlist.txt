Passionfruit Wishlist

This is a roadmap of sorts, with a more playful approach. This can also be considered the 
home of all of the issues I've found. Think of it as Christmas time for passionfruit, what 
needs to be fixed and what should be added.


Version 1.0.2 Wishlist
-	Fix browser detect bugs
-	Separate passionfuit from the index.php file into it's own include as passionfruit.php
-	Better fix for the $_fancybox.close runaway timer
-	Update demo html/css, removing pixels for percentage to prevent the body being wider 
	then the browser viewport
-	Combine javascript includes into a single file sans errors
-	iOS display error fix
-	Better documentation for 3rd party script implementation (help users access features in
	isotope, queryloader, bbq, cloud-zoom and fancybox)
-	meta.txt file generator on the demo site
-	Better optimization documentation (passionfruit can be slow if you have 200+ iamges)
-	Fix back button bug (inability to go back to the original load state)
-	Fix recursive gallery loading when 4+ levels deep
-	Optimize php array and variable access in the passionfruit() php function

Version 1.1 Wishlist
-	Enable ajax/json API so you only load and append content you want to see instead of 
	being serverd the whole enchilada all at once (this is what makes this a 1.1 release)
	
-	Develop the plugin framework (or the lack there of)
-	Add plugin for external image storage support (S/FTP)
-	Add plugin for initial thumbnail build (script you run if thumbs don't exist to get a 
	new gallery or album up and running without the need for external/additional prep)
-	Automatic detection of sortable classes (from all meta.txt) and link creation 
-	Breadcrumbs with titles with links to active content
-	Add mobile plugin
