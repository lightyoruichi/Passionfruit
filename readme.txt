1	INTRODUCTION

Passionfruit is a simple and clean photo gallery that avoids the nonsense of
backend interfaces and databases. The gallery uses a single file to read the
contents of images in your gallery folder and outputs the gallery as html
for viewing.

Passionfruit uses PHP to find images and metadata in your thumbs directory. 
You can have any number of directories with pictures (hereafter events), and 
you can cascade events as far as you wish.



2	GETTING STARTED

To use passionfruit, place your full images in the 'images' directory and  
thumbnails in the 'thumbs' directory. Make sure the full image and thumbnail
have the same filename, and the path to these files are the same. Example:

    For an image from the beach and barcelona albums, 
    the paths could be: 	/images/barcelona/beach/IMG_1.jpg
    						/thumbs.barcelona/beach/IMG_1.jpg
    
You may name the albums anything you want. The folder names should have no 
spaces. To have a pretty album name, read about the meta.txt file below. 
Avoid naming events/directories the foillowing: box, img, dir, bg, lb

Your image thumbnails should all be the same width, height does not matter.
The default is 200px wide. You can change this below and in the passionfruit
javascript file (change both to make it work properly). Full Images can be 
any size, just be aware that bigger images take more server space and longer 
to load. You can utilize the fancybox + cloudzoom feature of this gallery for
showcasing large images such as panoramas and detailed images.



3	ALBUM METADATA with meta.txt

To use the metadata features for albums, you should place a 'meta.txt' file
in each thumb event directory, with the following variables in a single line
string separated by commas:

$event_name,$zoom,$cover,$tags

$event_name		The event title, you can use spaces here
$zoom			'no' prevents the follow the cursor zoom feature in lightbox
$cover			event cover image, enter filename only
$tags			tags are single words, separated by spaces, for filtering  
    			images via isotope (i.e. spain barcelona casa_mila)

An example meta.txt file could look like this:
Tour of Casa Mila,no,image1234.jpg,spain barcelona casa_mila

See the example meta.txt and gallery structure included with this build to  
see sample foramtting of the meta file. If things are just not working out
of the box, keep reading.



4	CREDITS 

Passionfruit relies on the jQuery javascript library and uses a number of 
scripts by awesome people, these include:
	jQuery 1.6.2 by John Resig (http://jquery.org)
	Isotope 1.5.03 by David DeSandro (http://isotope.metafizzy.co)
	Fancybox 1.3.4 by Janis Skarnelis(http://fancybox.net/)

5	KNOWN ISSUES
	Empty folders still show as blank boxes.
	Folders 4 levels deep don't show images
	Runaway javascript counter when using the built in fancy box next/previous 
		navigation (they are disabled in the current version avoiding trouble)
	Back button doesn't take you to the top level gallery listing

Thanks for playing and have a nice day!



7	TROUBLESHOOTING & WARRANTY

As with any computer related software, there are always the inevitable errors 
and problems with implementation. Passionfruit began as a personal project so
it comes as-is with NO WARRANTY. I have done my best to document the software
but if you have a problem, try searching for a solution before giving up.

Below is a small attempt at offering some help for some more common issues.

First, before changing functions and code, make sure your server has the 
necessary pre-reqs. They are a LAMP server with Apache, PHP5 and GD. It will 
work on other servers (IIS, etcâ€¦) but I have not tested on anything other then
Apache, and the .htaccess file included to help optimize the gallery may not
work on other systems without custom setup.

Upload the provided package and put it on your server, if it loads and looks 
right, your server is all fine and dandy. If not, try checking your software.

	You can check your PHP version with <?php php_info(); ?>
	You can check your GD version with <?php var_dump(gd_info()); ?>
	


8	COMMON ERRORS

Error: Warning: getimagesize(images/event/IMG_1234.jpg) [function.getimagesize]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /path/to/your/website/index.php on line 146
	This means your image in the thumbs folder doesn't have a match in the images folder. 
	Check naming (ie the extension must be the same) and path. So if my image (IMG_1234.jpg) 
	is in my thumbs folder (/thumbs/event/IMG_1234.jpg), then the big version of this image
	must be in (/images/event/IMG_1234.jpg)
	
	NOTE: IMG_1234.JPG is not equal to IMG_1234.jpg (note the extension).

If your event/folder shows up but no images show up, this may mean you have a space in your 
	folder name. Make sure all folders have no spaces in them, so instead of (Family Trip 2011), 
	you can use (family_trip_2011). Keep in mind that you can set event covers and the title 
	(with spaces) in a meta.txt file.




9	EXTRA OPTIONS AND FEATURES

Passionfruit makes it easy to embed in a site. The easiest way to get the gallery working
is to start with the provided package. If you want to embed it into your website and you 
have images organized as outlined above, you can edit the bottom of the index.php file.

Passionfruit includes a simple header and footer by default, you can remove the include lines 
in the gallery script and start the function by including the script and by calling the 
passionfruit() function when and where you want a gallery. I would recommend renaming the 
script to passionfruit.php if you are going to do this.

Include the php script
	include('path/to/passionfruit.php);
	
Call the function
	passionfruit($dir,$dir_images,$class_dir,$class_img,$path,$currentdir,$zoom,$properpath,$metatags)
	
	The variables in the function are listed below. All are required (some can be left blank with '')

	$variable		type		['default']  description
	
	$dir			string		['thumbs ']  path to the thumbs directory (thumbs/ is default, make sure you include the trailing slash)
	$dir_images		string		['images ']  path to the images directory (images/ is default, make sure you include the trailing slash)
	$class_dir		string		['dir']  css class for directory div (dir by default)
	$class_img		string		['img']  css class for image div (img by default)
	$path			string		['']  relative path to the thumbs, leave blank if the thumbs and images directories are in the same directory as this script.
	$currentdir		string		['']  the current directory, leave blank at beginning. the function uses this to search directories in directories
	$zoom			string		['yes' or 'no']  cloud zoom feature for the top level gallery, on by default. this is set by the meta.txt files for recursive albums. 
	$properpath		string		['']  used to make nice thumbnails, uses information from the meta.txt file if available
	$metatags		string		['']  css classes for sorting, uses information from the meta.txt file if available 
	
Options for Navigation

You can make text links (<a>) to control and sort the gallery. Links use classes to sort 
through images and folders so if a folder has a class, you can sort it. You set classes 
for folders and images within by placing tags in the meta.txt files for each album/folder. 

A sorting link should have the class filter and link to #filter-[html element you want]
Examples:

A back button
	<a class="filter" id="backbutton" style="display:none;" href="#back" onclick="window.history.back();">&larr; Back</a>
	
Gallery Home link (resets the gallery)
	<a class="filter" href="#filter=.homebox" class="selected">Gallery Home</a>
	
Show all images and folders (filter is blank)
	<a class="filter" href="#filter=">All Images and Folders</a>
	
Show All folders (folders always have the .dir class)
	<a class="filter" href="#filter=.dir">All Folders</a>
	
Show all images (images always have the .img class)
	<a class="filter" href="#filter=.img">All Images</a>
	
Custom Tags (space or planes)
	<a class="filter" href="#filter=.space">Space</a> <!-- space is a tag set in the meta.txt files -->
	<a class="filter" href="#filter=.planes">Planes</a>
	
Make sure you include the . for classes. You can select multiple classes as well, you must 
encode the link tho. The jQuery param() can encode links for sorting with tags 

	$.param({ filter: '.metal' })						>>		"#filter=.metal"
	$.param({ filter: '.alkali, alkaline-earth' })		>>		"#filter=.alkali%2C+alkaline-earth"
	$.param({ filter: ':not(.transition)' })			>>		"#filter=%3Anot(.transition)"
