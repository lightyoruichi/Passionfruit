Passionfruit Change Log, Known Issues and Wishlist

This is a roadmap of sorts, with a more playful approach. This can also be considered the 
home of all of the issues I've found. Think of it as Christmas time for passionfruit, what 
needs to be fixed and what should be added.

Changes in 1.0.2
-	Fixed browser detect bugs in detectmobile.php
-	Added plugin for initial thumbnail build (script you run if thumbs don't exist to get a 
	new gallery or album up and running without the need for external/additional prep)
-	Fixed htaccess file to include images in the gzip compression for faster load times
-	New cache rules for the htaccess file, allowing image storage in the browser cache
-	Update demo html/css, removing pixels for percentage to prevent the body being wider 
	then the browser viewport
-	Fixed the $_fancybox.close runaway timer

Changes in 1.0.3
-	The function now gathers image exif metadata, but doesn't do anything with it yet
-	iOS display error fix
-	Fixed createthumbs.php mkdir error
-	Added support for PHP4 for the createthumbs.php script (I still recommend PHP5)
-	Added documentation of htaccess use and optimization for the gallery
-	Numerous bug fixes in createthumbs.php

Changes in 1.0.4
-	Added feature allowing download parallelization by distributing the image requests 
	across multiple hostnames. This will allow the speedup of loading, especially for 
	galleries with 100+ images. It will only work if your site supports wildcard subdomains.
	*Note: This has only been tested on apache servers, see documentation on enabling it.
-	Fixed cache bug forcing the main gallery html to be downloaded instead of displayed
-	Replaced getimagesize() with exif_imagetype() for image verification to speed up the
	script and to optimize memory use
-	Optimized the createthumbs script with the exif_imagetype function
-	Added more exif data support (doesn't do anything yet but is more efficient then the
	last version)
-	Added hover and active effects for improved usability
-	Changed how meta.txt files work.
-	Added background-size: cover so folder/gallery background images will fill the box
	instead of cropping most of the image, especially for larger images.

Version 1.0.4 - Current Version as of 26 December 2011

Known Issues
-	Need to combine javascript includes into a single file sans errors
-	Need better documentation for 3rd party script implementation (help users access features 
	in isotope, queryloader, bbq, cloud-zoom and fancybox)
-	Back button bug (inability to go back to the original load state)
-	Recursive gallery loading when 3+ levels deep will not process/output images
-	QueryLoader fails when download parallelization is enabled due to json cross-domain rules,
	this only affects users utilizing download parallelization.  

Version 1.1 Wishlist
-	Enable ajax/json API so you only load and append content you want to see instead of 
	being served the whole enchilada all at once (this is what makes this a 1.1 release)
-	Add plugin for external image storage support (S/FTP)
-	Automatic detection of sortable classes (from all meta.txt) and link creation 
-	Breadcrumbs with titles with links to active content
-	Add mobile plugin
-	meta.txt file generator on the demo site
-	Optimize php array and variable access in the passionfruit() php function
-	Access to image attributes in display interface (1.0.2 sets variables with exif data
	but does not pass it on to the browser for use, I don't have a good UI for it yet...)
-	Mapping support for albums (set via meta file)
-	Mapping support for individual geotagged images
